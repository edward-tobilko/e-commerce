This project has a cool calendar, a neat board for organizing tasks, and a useful editor. It also has special pages for handling orders, customers, and employees. You can check out different charts to understand data better, easily pick products with a shopping basket, and order them without any trouble. You can also make your own page where you can write notes and talk to others. Change the colors of the page and buttons to make it your own. And don't worry about logging in and out - it's easy, and your preferences are always saved.
